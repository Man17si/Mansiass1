		An authoritative Virat Kohli headlined India's utterly dominant performance with his 45th<br> ODI hundred as the hosts pummelled Sri Lanka by 67 runs in the first of the three-match series<br> in Guwahati on Tuesday. Asked to bat first, India rode former skipper Kohli's 87-ball 113 and<br> fluent half-centuries from his successor Rohit Sharma (83) and Shubman Gill (70) to rake up<br> an imposing 373 for seven in their allotted quota of overs on a batting-friendly strip. In reply,<br> the Sri Lankans were never in the hunt and ended at 306 for eight in 50 overs to hand the hosts<br> a 1-0 lead in the rubber

		India captain Rohit Sharma is one of the finest batters in the cricket world. From playing ma-<br>mmoth knocks toplaying one of the most sensible innings, there is hardly anything the star co-<br>uld not do while batting. However, even the best get to face challenges and some even trouble<br> them to a great extent. Rohit, the batter, too has faced such a bowler who has challenged him a<br> lot.The surprising fact is that it is not a bowler from Pakistan or Australia as many would ass-<br>ume, it is rather a former South African pacer-Dale Steyn.
